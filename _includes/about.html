    The Christina Analytics were born as part of a larger library developed for a private hedge fund operating on crypto
    currencies since 2017. The quantitative research developed in the original work resulted in a number of charts and
    trading indicators that could be useful to a wider audience of crypto-currency trader. The quantitative model uses a
    mixed approach taking advantage of big-data analytics and stochastic process modelling. While the model computations
    are very computing-intensive we created an interface to the Christina Analytics to make them available using
    internet API
