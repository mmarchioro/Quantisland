Quant Island (sometimes spelled QuantIsland) is the company I created in order to independently work on the subjects I care about. The consulting services provided by QuantIsland are not limited to quantitative finance but extend to the much wider realm of FinTech. Since QuantIsland is registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority of Singapore (ACRA) it can be in businessÂ  relationships with firms worldwide.
